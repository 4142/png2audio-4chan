4chan player for PNG filed created with [audio2png](https://github.com/4142/audio2png).

Please note that this script was thrown together pretty quickly and is probably full of bugs. If you're using Firefox, you'll need to download the Greasemonkey extension. As far as I know, this will only work under Firefox and Chrome.

**You can download the script [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4142/png2audio-4chan/master/png2audio-4chan.user.js).**

Makes use of [pngjs](https://github.com/arian/pngjs).
